{"name":"Powershell Editor","tagline":"Powershell Editor Eclipse Plugin","body":"## Powershell Editor plug-in for Eclipse - Why?\r\n\r\nActually it's hard to find a free convenient IDE for Powershell. Probably currently the most suitable is Notepad++. Still there are lots of functionalities missing, like extended syntax highlighting, code completion of source formatting. \r\nThis projects tends to create the most functional IDE for Powershell based on Eclipse.\r\n\r\n## The plug-in features\r\nThe plug-in provides its own perspective:\r\n![intro](http://www.dmitryalexandrov.net/pseditor/intro.png)\r\n\r\nOn load, the plug-in scans the system for all installed modules and snapins and adds them into highlighting library:\r\n![syntax](http://www.dmitryalexandrov.net/pseditor/syntax.png)\r\n\r\nBut not only for syntax highlighting, but also for code completion. The completion works not just statically but also scans for changes in the included files. The bracket pairs are also highlighted.\r\nUsing **F3** button over function you can go to the file and place it has been defined.\r\nUsing **Ctrl+/** you can comment out lines.\r\n![complete](http://www.dmitryalexandrov.net/pseditor/complete.png)\r\n\r\nThe editor now has basic formatting\r\n![formatter](http://www.dmitryalexandrov.net/pseditor/format.png)\r\n\r\nThe plug-in has its own console and launch configurator. So you can launch you scripts directly in the IDE\r\n![console](http://www.dmitryalexandrov.net/pseditor/console.png)\r\n\r\n## Things to come\r\n- Interactive console\r\n- Outline perspective\r\n- More complex formatting\r\n- Link to debugger\r\n\r\n## Feel free to contribute!","google":"UA-37060417-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
